Depending on how you install KubeVela, you can choose the way to access the [endpoint]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_8080}}).

```shell
vela port-forward webservice-app -n default 8080:8080
```{{exec}}

This command will open a browser automatically. Or you could access the endpoint by [URL]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_8080}}) in your browser.
