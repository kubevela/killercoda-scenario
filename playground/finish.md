## Visit VelaUX

RUN `vela port-forward -n vela-system addon-velaux 8000:8000 --address='0.0.0.0'`{{exec}}

>Warning: `--address='0.0.0.0'` is just to adapt to the [killercoda.com](https://github.com/killercoda/scenario-examples/blob/main/network-traffic/step1.md) platform and is not a requirement!

You can visit velaux by this dynamically rendered [endpoint]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_8000}}).

> Currently killercoda does not support split screen display of pages and courses. You can follow the [official documentation](https://kubevela.io/docs/tutorials/webservice) after you have started VelaUX.

## Other
